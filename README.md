# ü™ë WebGL 3D Scene

This project is developed as part of a course assignment to create a 3D scene in 4 versions using WebGL. The scene includes a table and two chairs and supports various user interactions such as rotating the camera and manipulating objects within the scene.

## üì¶ Libraries Used

- `webgl-debug.js` for WebGL debug messages
- `gl-matrix-min.js` for creating and managing matrices and transformations

## üïπÔ∏è Features

- **Input Textfields** to adjust field of view (in degrees), distance of the camera from the beginning of the axes (all .html)
- **Radio Buttons** to define camera position. (all .html)
- **3D rendering of a cube** with different colors for every face (sceneV1.html)
- **3D rendering of a table and two chairs** (sceneV1.html, sceneV2.html, sceneV3.html)
- **Textures for objects** (sceneV3.html, sceneV4.html)
- **Camera rotation animation** (start and stop buttons - sceneV3.html, sceneV4.html) 
- **Skybox** to enhance the scene background (sceneV4.html)
- **Control Camera** height and rotation with mouse right click (sceneV4.html)
- **Frames Per Second - FPS** calculation (sceneV4.html)
